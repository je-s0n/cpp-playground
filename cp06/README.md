## Part 6. friend와 static 그리고 const
1) C++에서의 const - [ConstObject.cpp](https://github.com/je-s0n/cpp-playground/blob/main/cp06/ConstObject.cpp), [ConstOverloading.cpp](https://github.com/je-s0n/cpp-playground/blob/main/cp06/ConstOverloading.cpp)
2) 클래스와 함수에 대한 friend 선언 - [MyFriendClass.cpp](https://github.com/je-s0n/cpp-playground/blob/main/cp06/MyFriendClass.cpp), [MyFriendFunction.cpp](https://github.com/je-s0n/cpp-playground/blob/main/cp06/MyFriendFunction.cpp)
3) C++에서의 static - [CComStatic.cpp](https://github.com/je-s0n/cpp-playground/blob/main/cp06/CComStatic.cpp), [NeedGlobal.cpp](https://github.com/je-s0n/cpp-playground/blob/main/cp06/NeedGlobal.cpp), [StaticMember.cpp](https://github.com/je-s0n/cpp-playground/blob/main/cp06/StaticMember.cpp), [PublicStaticMember.cpp](https://github.com/je-s0n/cpp-playground/blob/main/cp06/PublicStaticMember.cpp), [ConstStaticMember.cpp](https://github.com/je-s0n/cpp-playground/blob/main/cp06/ConstStaticMember.cpp), [Mutable.cpp](https://github.com/je-s0n/cpp-playground/blob/main/cp06/Mutable.cpp)
